      <h2>Client Report</h2>

      <h3>How did you decide what content and images to use for your site plan?</h3>
      <p>For my images I chose related styling, as my site is a programming language review, I decided to use computers, programming language, and code snippets for the images.</p>

      <h3>How did you communicate with your developer? Was there any issues with communication?</h3>
      <p>I used email for all my communications. Particuarly with my Jr developer, I couldn't get in contact with them at all, so I decided to do their job.</p>

      <h3>Did your developer meet your expectations for your site?</h3>
      <p>Due to many people not showing up for the final project, I can't put the whole blame on my Developer, but the website had no child pages, other than that yes it was as expected.</p>

      <h3>What will you do differently next time you hire a team to do a project for you?</h3>
      <p>I will be more diligent in setting up communication channels and ensuring all team members are present and engaged.</p>

      <h3>What was the most challenging part of this project for you? Were you able to overcome it?</h3>
      <p>The most challenging part of this project for me was managing the time constraints and coordinating with my team members effectively. I was able to overcome it by not procastinating and maintaining regular communication.</p>

      <p>Yes, I feel more confident in working on real-world projects after this experience. I learned how to effectively communicate with team members, manage time constraints, and use tools like GitHub for collaboration.</p>
